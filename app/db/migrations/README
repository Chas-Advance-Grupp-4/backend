Generic single-database configuration.

# Initialize Alembic / start it in the project and create necessary files/folders (only done once)
alembic init migrations

# Create a new migration/version. Run this whenever the database schema changes,
# e.g., when adding or removing tables or columns. 
# Autogenerate automatically compares the models defined in code with the database.
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Descriptive text of what was done"

# Apply the migration and update the database to the latest version
alembic upgrade head

# Roll back a migration / revert one version (you can also specify a specific migration ID instead of -1 to go to that specifik version/migration.)
alembic downgrade -1
